**Arc** version 1.1.2 is now available for [download](https://code.cubewise.com/arc-download/). 

## Enhancements
* ODBC and text file preview now uses the REST API on 11.3 or later. What that means is Arc doesnâ€™t need to be on the server to access these data sources. It also provides a list of DSNs on the server instead of a text box in the process data source UI.

## Fixes
* Sandboxes dimension will not be inserted when you use intellisense feature either through ctrl+space or cube drag and drop. [#213](https://github.com/cubewise-code/arc-issues/issues/213)
* Server Logs shows now time and date. [#212](https://github.com/cubewise-code/arc-issues/issues/212)
