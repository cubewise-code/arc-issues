**Arc** version 1.2.0 is now available for [download](https://code.cubewise.com/arc-download/). 

## Enhancements
* Arc uses now a new multi-window layout manager:
  * You can view editors side-by-side, for example cube rules on one side and cube viewer on the other.
  * To use the new layout manager drag the tab heading to the location you want the editor to be located. It can be to left/right, top/bottom or beside another tab.
